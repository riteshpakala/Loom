## WARNING

- If Loom requests for "Local Network Access" it is because a neighboring server is using a localhost equivalent address. It is not because of the application itself. So please DO NOT ALLOW ACCESS. (unless you are expecting it).

| Expanded Layout (iPad/macOS)   | |
| :-------- | -------: |
| ![Image](Resources/README/1.gif) | [Granite](https://github.com/pexavc/Granite) supports macOS. Same navigation API can direct window spawning or navigation stack pushing. |
| ![Image](Resources/README/2.png) | Spawn multiple windows of entire feed layouts with multiple communities to observe. Will be helpful in the case of moderating multiple communities for instance. |

| Looms    | |
| :-------- | -------: |
| ![Image](Resources/README/3.gif) | Create "Looms" of any group of communities from any instance. Merging their content into a singular feed.|

| Explore    | |
| :-------- | -------: |
| ![Image](Resources/README/4.gif)  | Visit linked instances when connected to a lemmy server. View small snippets of each and their ping response time.   |

| Aggregation Sources (Aside from Lemmy)    | |
| :-------- | -------: |
| ![Image](Resources/README/5.gif)  | RSS feeds can be pulled when setting the instance URL to a valid endpoint. Pagination is not currently supported, but will be in the future. Looking at supporting Atom/JSON streams as well.   |
| ![Image](Resources/README/6.gif)  | Mastodon feeds can be pulled when setting the instance URL to a valid mastodon instance. Pagination is not currently supported, but will be in the future. Interactions are disabled for the time being `2023-9-4`.   |

| Safety    | |
| :-------- | -------: |
| ![Image](Resources/README/7.gif)  | On-device CoreML models + keyword filtering to remove posts from the feed. `NSFW Extended` will remove posts that are detected as NSFW even if they are not flagged as so.     |

| Styling    | |
| :-------- | -------: |
| ![Image](Resources/README/8.gif)  |  Intended to allow full user customization in the future. Currently supports a "social app feel" and a "reddit-like reader".   |

| MD helper  | |
| :-------- | -------: |
| ![Image](Resources/README/9.gif) | Keyboard toolbar provides easy to access shortcuts on iPhone/iPad to help with Markdown formatting. |

| Travelling Modals    | |
| :-------- | -------: |
| ![Image](Resources/README/10.gif)  | Writing modals can travel with your viewing context. Allowing you to browse content in any stack prior to publishing.   |

| Bookmark Syncing    | |
| :-------- | -------: |
| ![Image]()  | All your saved posts and comments can be switched between accounts in a dedicated component.   |

| Sharing    | |
| :-------- | -------: |
| ![Image](Resources/README/11.gif) | Share posts or comments as images. With the intention of supporting QR codes and *Engravings* in the future. |

| Search    | |
| :-------- | -------: |
| ![Image](Resources/README/12.gif) | Either search all, a specific subcategory with sort support. View expanded contents within the view, interacting with content as normal. |

| Profile    | |
| :-------- | -------: |
| ![Image](Resources/README/13.gif) | Dynamic threads, despite viewing context. Swipe to reply to comments or tap the more button, to modify, remove, block, etc.  |
| ![Image](Resources/README/14.gif) | Deleting and restoring with toast reactions. |
| ![Image](Resources/README/15.gif) | Switch accounts, view their profiles, and their scores. |

| Embedded Webview    | |
| :-------- | -------: |
| ![Image](Resources/README/16.gif) | Custom JS insertion supported, customizing how webpages are viewed via direct user input is a possibility. |

| Light Mode    | |
| :-------- | -------: |
| ![Image](Resources/README/17.gif) | Light mode and Dark mode supported. Refer to the color group in `Assets` to define your own preferences for each. |




## Contributing

Loom uses [Granite](https://github.com/pexavc/Granite) as a backing for components and services. The Components folder in this repo serves as a good example for many future components that may be needed. Any suggestions on Granite or other component layouts as a whole is greatly appreciated. Always feel free to open a PR and/or Issue.

An interactive websites to generate boilerplate components using a GUI to define styling and needed state properties is in the works! This will allow you to simply download the generated component and drag into XCode for immediate use.

### Why Granite?

Mostly because of *Relays* and project organization. I'd say testing too, but once I get around towards writing the unit tests, I'd feel more confident in sharing the strengths then. These work like @Observables/@AppStorage, but are more flexible in initializations and caching data. The ability to simply declare relays in any `View` or `GraniteComponent` allows for a more effective iterative process and cleaner context passing throughout the application.

```swift
@Relay var configService: ConfigService
```
